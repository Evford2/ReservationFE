                A few years ago, some friends and I began to make it a yearly tradition to attend the Texas Renaissance Festival. We also love to camp, but hated wanted a bit more solitude
                than what is offered at the Ren Fest campgrounds. This land has been in my family for decades now and is conveniently located about 10 minutes from the festival. With their permission, 
                we would camp there each year. The pine trees, the clear air, and the dark night skies made it the perfect camping spot. Now we are wanting to share this with other festival goers who
                desire a similar experience!
